C#: We N3eD MoRe F!SH. DEPL0Y THA DEEP-FISHR-9000!
====================

The  Fishing Company (FC™) has invented a new form of fishing: Underwater fishing!!! ZOMG!

Our new protoype deep sea vessel (The DEEP-FISHR-9000) needs to be deployed ASAP... 

"Why" you ask? Because the ocean is running out of fish and we need to take deep sea fishing to a whole new level baby!

Without the success of this prototype vessel, The FC™ will *GO UNDER*! (pun very much intended)
